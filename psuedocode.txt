important stuff:

THIS GETS OUR LYRICS TO THE PAGE
create array containing titles of our songs
create url query variables
loop through song array for search query
use ajax and the url query to get the songs json from musix match
**the following depends on what musix match allows for**
grab a snippet of lyrics from the song and store it in an an array
we need to figure out how to make each word become its own index in the array
another for loop to cycle through the array and start appending the lyrics to the page

GAME LOGIC:
user inputs a song title and submits
take the value of the user input - ignore case, ignore spacing, ignore punctuation - check if the value exists in our song array
if it exists AND the timer is 0-15 seconds - add 100 points to current score, stop timer - display youtube video of song - a button is created allowing user to go to next song when they are done enjoying
else if it exists AND the timer is 15-30 seconds - add 50 points to current score, stop timer - play song from spotify - a button is created allowing user to go to next song when they are done enjoying
else if it does not exist - no points added, timer stops, lives counter goes down by 1, go to next song immedietly

when next song question starts - timer reset to 30 - go to next song in array



game end conditions:
if live counter reaches zero - load end screen
if user answer all 20 songs - load end screen
if either conditions are met current score becomes final score

nice to have:
allow user to input initials to attach to their final score
display initials and score on a leaderboard if they make it to the top 5 scores

COUNTERS
lives counter - starts at 5 - goes down for every incorrect guess of song titles
timer - starts at 30 seconds - goes down every second until 0
current score - starts at 0 - goes up by 100 if answer is guessed in 0-15 seconds goes up by 50 if answer is guessed in 15-30 seconds
